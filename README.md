# Monitoring Environment

This project sets up a basic monitoring environment using Docker, Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter.

### Prerequisites

Docker Engine and Docker Compose should be installed on the system. 

If both are not installed, the instructions can be found below. Alternatively, you may refer to the official Docker Engine [installation manual for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).
```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install the latest Docker Engine and Docker Compose versions:
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:
sudo docker run hello-world

# Verify that Docker Compose is installed and working: 
sudo docker compose version
```

You may also need to add your user to the `docker` group upon installing Docker. The steps for this process are described in [Linux post-installation steps for Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coffeeandtv07/monitoring_env.git
```      

2. Go to the project directory:
```bash
cd monitoring_env
```

The project's configuration files are in docker-compose.yml and prometheus.yml files. 

Main Docker container configuration is in `docker-compose.yml` â€” this config defines the 'monitoring' network, and specifies the Grafana, Node Exporter, Prometheus service settings.
Settings include image sources, volumes that should be mounted, custom commands the services should be executed with, and ports to bind the services to.
Make sure that ports 3000, 9100, 9090 are allowed in your firewall.

The `prometheus.yml` config specifies the scrape interval and job names that should be scraped. Apart from the Prometheus and Node Exporter, no other custom jobs are included into the config.
Jobs like 'cpu' and 'memory' are included into Prometheus by default.

3. Start the monitoring environment:
```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

This command will pull the necessary Docker images and start the services. The following commands stops the Docker container:
```bash
sudo docker compose down
```

### Usage

Grafana: 

Access the Grafana dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or http://[your_server_ip]:3000. 
The default login credentials are:

    Username: admin
    Password: tgpSbeYzGAyxDt
  
Grafana Dashboards can be configured afterwards. Refer to the [official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/) for more details.

Prometheus: 

Access the Prometheus UI at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) or http://[your_server_ip]:9090.
